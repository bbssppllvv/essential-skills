Write copy people read, trust, remember, and act on.

Read [references/copywriting-guide.md](references/copywriting-guide.md) before writing any copy. It contains the full methodology.

## Core rule

**Clarity > Respect > Character.** Always in this order.

## Workflow

### 1. Classify the context

Determine what is being written:

| Type | Key sections from guide |
|------|------------------------|
| UI microcopy (buttons, errors, empty states) | Sections 6, 8 |
| Product flows (onboarding, settings) | Sections 3, 6, 8 |
| Marketing / landing page | Sections 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18 |
| Full page or mixed | All sections apply |

### 2. Apply the universal structure

Every piece of copy must answer (explicitly or implicitly):

1. **Context** — where is the user?
2. **Job** — what are they trying to do?
3. **Solution** — what do you offer?
4. **Outcome** — what changes?
5. **Conditions** — limits, tradeoffs
6. **Next step** — what to do now

### 3. Write living words, kill dead ones

Before outputting any line, check: could this appear on 1,000 websites unchanged? If yes, rewrite with a concrete detail, number, or scenario.

### 4. Match tone to stakes

- **Low stakes** (onboarding, tooltips, success): warmth and personality allowed
- **High stakes** (errors, payments, deletion, security): calm, clear, zero personality

### 5. Self-check before output

Run the 7-point checklist (guide section 7):
1. Understandable in 3 seconds?
2. "Why should I care?" answered?
3. At least one concrete detail?
4. Can cut 30% without losing meaning?
5. Expectations honest?
6. Next step obvious?
7. Sounds human?

For marketing copy, also run the memorability checklist (guide section 19).

## Quick patterns

**Buttons**: action + object ("Save changes", "Start free trial")

**Errors**: what happened + what to do ("You're offline. Reconnect to save changes.")

**Empty states**: teach + guide + one CTA ("Projects will appear here. Create your first one.")

**Hero section**: headline (outcome) + subhead (how) + proof/constraint + CTA

**Sticky lines**: "Not another X. Finally Y." / "Less noise. More decisions." / "Stop guessing. Start seeing."

**Before/After**: pain -> intervention -> concrete win

## Never use

Hype: revolutionary, seamless, cutting-edge, best-in-class, next-generation

Filler: very, really, just, actually, basically, literally, simply

Corporate: leverage, synergy, ecosystem, paradigm, holistic, empower

AI slop: "In today's fast-paced world", "Say goodbye to", "Supercharge your", "Take X to the next level"

Full banned list in guide section 21.
