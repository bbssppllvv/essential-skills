# The Complete Product & Website Copywriting Guide

How to write copy people read, trust, remember, and act on.

---

## 0. Core belief

People do not read copy. They make decisions.

Copy is not content. Copy is an interface between a person and a next step.

If text does not help someone understand, choose, or act — it actively hurts the product.

---

## 1. The order of great copy

**Clarity > Respect > Character**

Always in this order.
- **Clarity**: without it, copy fails
- **Respect**: without it, copy irritates
- **Character**: without it, copy is forgotten

Most bad "brand voice" starts with character and skips clarity.

---

## 2. Living words vs dead words

**Dead copy** — abstract, generic, safe, interchangeable, unprovable.
Signal: it could live on 1,000 websites unchanged.

| Dead | Living |
|------|--------|
| "Innovative platform" | "Create a landing page in 20 minutes. No code." |
| "Next-generation solution" | "See where users drop off in checkout." |
| "Seamless experience" | "Export to PDF and Google Docs in one click." |
| "Powerful and flexible" | "Works with Gmail and Outlook. iCloud is next." |

**Rule**: If a word can be removed without changing meaning, it is probably dead.

---

## 3. The universal structure

Any good piece of copy answers these questions (explicitly or implicitly):

1. **Context** — Where is the user right now?
2. **Job to be done** — What are they trying to accomplish?
3. **Solution** — What do you offer?
4. **Outcome** — What changes for them?
5. **Conditions** — Limits, tradeoffs, requirements, timing
6. **Next step** — What should they do now?

If copy feels "empty", one of these is missing.

---

## 4. Info-style thinking

Not about sounding boring. About helping decisions.

1. Facts beat adjectives: "fast" -> "in 10 seconds"
2. Verbs beat nouns: "configuration" -> "set up"
3. Plain word order: say what happens first, details later
4. One sentence = one idea
5. Higher stakes = calmer tone (payments, deletion, access, security)

Info-style is the foundation, not the ceiling.

---

## 5. Tone of voice as a system

- **Voice** is stable: who you are
- **Tone** changes with context

Define voice using "X, but not Y":
- Friendly, but not familiar
- Confident, but not arrogant
- Smart, but not academic
- Playful, but not goofy
- Direct, but not harsh

---

## 6. Where personality belongs (and where it doesn't)

**Use warmth/playfulness when** the user is exploring, safe, learning, or stakes are low:
- Onboarding, empty states, tooltips, success messages, secondary marketing sections

**Avoid personality when** the user is anxious or might lose something:
- Errors, payments, deletion, permissions, security

**Rule**: The more stress, the more clarity. Less character.

---

## 7. Universal pre-publish checklist

1. Can a stranger understand this in 3 seconds?
2. Is "why should I care?" answered clearly?
3. Is there at least one concrete detail?
4. Can I cut 30% without losing meaning?
5. Are expectations honest (limits included)?
6. Is the next step obvious?
7. Does it sound human, not corporate?

Two or more "no" = rewrite.

---

## 8. Microcopy

### Buttons

Bad: OK, Submit, Confirm

Good — action + object:
- Create project
- Save changes
- Invite teammates
- Download PDF
- Start free trial

### Errors

Good errors include: (1) what happened, (2) why (if useful), (3) what to do next.

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Bad | "Something went wrong" |
| Better | "Couldn't save. Check your connection and try again." |
| Best | "You're offline. Reconnect to save changes." |

### Empty states

Not "No data".

Teach and guide: "Projects will appear here. Create your first one to get started."

One CTA. Not five.

---

## 9. Marketing hero section

Must answer instantly:
- Who is this for?
- What problem does it solve?
- What outcome do I get?
- Why should I trust it?
- What do I do next?

**Example**:

Headline: "Turn meeting notes into decisions."

Subhead: "Record, transcribe, and summarize calls in real time on macOS."

Proof/constraint: "English and Spanish supported. 60-minute meetings."

CTA: "Try it free"

---

## 10. Proof beats hype

**Trust-killing words**: revolutionary, seamless, cutting-edge, best-in-class, next-generation

**Replace with**: numbers, scenarios, constraints, real outputs, real limits

Honesty increases credibility. Credibility increases impact.

---

## 11. Attention hooks

The first line must create curiosity.

| Hook type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Contrast | "Most AI tools save time. This one wastes it first." |
| Recognition | "You opened email for 5 minutes. You're still there 40 minutes later." |
| Uncomfortable truth | "The problem isn't your focus. It's your interface." |
| Expectation flip | "Not another AI assistant. A decision shortcut." |

Interest first. Explanation second.

---

## 12. Write in scenes, not claims

People remember images, not abstractions.

Bad: "A better workflow for teams."

Good: "At 10:03 the PM drops a task. At 10:07 the designer has real references and a draft."

Scene template: who + where + what happens + what changes.

If you can see it, you can remember it.

---

## 13. Rhythm

Flat rhythm kills attention. Use variation: short line, longer line, short punch.

"Fewer clicks.
Clearer decisions.
Less arguing in Slack."

Change sentence length every 1-2 lines.

---

## 14. One paragraph = one punch

If an idea needs explanation, justification, and example — that is three paragraphs, not one.

Only punchlines stick.

---

## 15. Sticky lines (the quote test)

Every important page needs at least one line that can be screenshotted, quoted, remembered.

Patterns:
- "Not another X. Finally Y."
- "Less noise. More decisions."
- "Not perfect. Useful today."
- "Stop guessing. Start seeing."
- "Clarity before cleverness."

If nothing is quotable, nothing sticks.

---

## 16. Emotion through honesty

Stronger: "We don't replace designers. We remove busywork."

Weaker: "AI that transforms the future of design."

Precision beats volume.

---

## 17. Before / After micro-stories

Format: Before (pain) -> Shift (intervention) -> After (concrete win)

"Before: debates in Slack about one button.
After: one screen with 20 real examples.
Decision in 5 minutes."

---

## 18. Copy with a point of view

Memorable copy has opinion.

Not: "We help teams work better."
But: "Guessing is the slowest design tool."

Formula: Bold claim -> concrete proof -> human line

"Stop guessing flows.
Search 100k real screens in seconds.
Ship with fewer debates."

---

## 19. Memorability checklist

1. Is there a line worth quoting?
2. Can I visualize a scene?
3. Is there contrast or surprise?
4. Does this have a clear point of view?
5. Does it sound like a person, not a committee?
6. Can I remove another 20% and sharpen the punch?

If most are "no" — the text will be understood, but forgotten.

---

## 20. Team rules

- One term = one meaning
- Prefer short sentences
- Every claim needs proof or constraint
- One block, one goal, one primary CTA
- Calm tone in high-stakes moments
- Maintain a banned-words list

---

## 21. Banned words list

Never use in copy output:

### Hype words
revolutionary, seamless, cutting-edge, best-in-class, next-generation, world-class, game-changing, disruptive, innovative (without proof), powerful (without specifics), robust, scalable (in marketing), enterprise-grade (without context), state-of-the-art, groundbreaking

### Filler words
very, really, just, actually, basically, literally, simply, easily, highly, incredibly, extremely, absolutely, truly, totally

### Corporate zombie phrases
leverage, synergy, ecosystem, paradigm, holistic, end-to-end, mission-critical, value proposition, stakeholder, thought leader, empower, optimize (in marketing), streamline (without specifics), unlock (metaphorical), drive (as in "drive growth")

### AI slop markers
"In today's fast-paced world...", "In an era of...", "Look no further", "Say goodbye to...", "Introducing the future of...", "Reimagine...", "Supercharge your...", "Elevate your...", "Take your X to the next level", "Harness the power of..."
