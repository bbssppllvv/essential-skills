# Orders & Subscriptions

## Sales

The sales view shows you all sales in a paginated list.

## Order & Subscription Details

Each sale has metadata attached to it. Common properties like:

* Amount
* Tax Amount
* Invoices
* Customer
  * Basic Customer Details
  * Past Orders

## Checkouts

You can also have an overview of all checkout sessions. You can filter them by customer email, status and product.

A checkout can be in the following states:

* **Open**: The checkout session is open and waiting for the customer to complete the payment.
* **Confirmed**: The customer clicked the **Pay** or **Subscribe** button and the payment is being processed.
* **Succeeded**: The payment was successful and the order was created.
* **Expired**: The checkout session expired and the customer can no longer complete it. A new checkout session must be created.

If you click on a Checkout, you can have more details on the **payment attempts**, in particular, why a payment has failed or has been declined.
