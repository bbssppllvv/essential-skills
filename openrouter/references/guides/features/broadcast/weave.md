# W&B Weave

Send traces to W&B Weave

[Weights & Biases Weave](https://wandb.ai/site/weave) is an observability platform for tracking and evaluating LLM applications.

## Step 1: Get your W&B API key

In W&B, go to your [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings) and copy your API key.

## Step 2: Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter

Go to [Settings > Observability](https://openrouter.ai/settings/observability) and toggle **Enable Broadcast**.

## Step 3: Configure W&B Weave

Click the edit icon next to **W&B Weave** and enter:

- **Api Key**: Your W&B API key
- **Entity**: Your W&B username or team name
- **Project**: The project name where traces will be logged
- **Base Url** (optional): Default is `https://trace.wandb.ai`

## Step 4: Test and save

Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup. The configuration only saves if the test passes.

## Step 5: Send a test trace

Make an API request through OpenRouter and view the trace in W&B Weave.

## Custom Metadata

W&B Weave supports custom attributes and structured inputs for organizing and analyzing your LLM calls.

### Supported Metadata Keys

| Key | Weave Mapping | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trace_id` | `openrouter_trace_id` attribute | Custom trace identifier stored in attributes |
| `trace_name` | `op_name` | Custom operation name displayed in the Weave call list |
| `generation_name` | `op_name` | Name for the LLM call |

### Example

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Write a poem about AI..." }],
  "user": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_abc",
  "trace": {
    "trace_name": "Creative Writing Agent",
    "prompt_template": "poem_v2",
    "experiment_name": "creative_benchmark",
    "dataset_version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Attributes and Inputs

Weave organizes trace data into:

- **Attributes**: Metadata about the call (user IDs, organization IDs, trace identifiers, custom metadata)
- **Inputs**: The actual request data including messages, model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
- **Summary**: Token usage, costs, and timing metrics

### Additional Context

- The `user` field maps to `user_id` in attributes
- The `session_id` field maps to `session_id` in attributes
- Custom metadata keys from `trace` are merged into the call's attributes
- Model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, top_p) are included in inputs for easy filtering

## Privacy Mode

When Privacy Mode is enabled for this destination, prompt and completion content is excluded from traces. All other trace data -- token usage, costs, timing, model information, and custom metadata -- is still sent normally.
