# Data Collection | OpenRouter Privacy

## Overview

When using AI through OpenRouter's chat interface or API, your prompts and responses pass through multiple points. You maintain control over how your data is managed at each stage.

## Prompt and Response Storage

OpenRouter maintains a straightforward policy: **prompts and responses are not retained** unless you actively enable prompt logging in your account settings.

The service does collect a limited sample of prompts for categorization purposes, which supports reporting and model evaluation. However, if you haven't opted into logging, this categorization remains completely anonymized and is never linked to your account or user ID.

## Metadata Handling

OpenRouter does preserve metadata associated with each request, including:
- Token counts (prompts and completions)
- Request latency
- Performance metrics

This metadata fuels their reporting features, model rankings, and the activity feed within your account. Importantly, this metadata collection does not encompass the actual content of your prompts or responses—only structural request information.
