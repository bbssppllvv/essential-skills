# Activity Export Documentation

## Overview

OpenRouter's Activity page enables users to monitor three key usage metrics: spending (combining OpenRouter credits and external BYOK costs), total tokens consumed, and request counts. The platform supports filtering by various time periods and grouping options to organize data by model, API key, or team member.

## Key Features

The Activity page displays three primary metrics:

- **Spend**: Combined costs from OpenRouter credits and "estimated BYOK spend based on market rates for that provider"
- **Tokens**: Aggregate token usage across prompts and completions
- **Requests**: Total AI request count, including chatroom interactions

Users can filter by timeframe (hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly) with automatic sub-grouping by the appropriate interval.

## Export Process

To export usage data:

1. Navigate to the Activity dashboard
2. Select desired time period and grouping preference
3. Access the options dropdown menu
4. Choose export format (CSV or PDF)

## Detailed Export Capabilities

Clicking individual metric cards provides granular breakdowns organized by your selected grouping criteria. Detailed exports can then be generated in CSV or PDF formats, with PDF reports including summary pages followed by individual breakdowns.

The documentation notes that "reasoning tokens are included in completion tokens for billing," clarifying how these specialized tokens factor into cost calculations.
