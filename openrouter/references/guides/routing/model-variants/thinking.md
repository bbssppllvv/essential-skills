# Thinking Variant: Extended Reasoning Documentation

## Overview

The `:thinking` variant activates extended reasoning capabilities designed for tackling complex problem-solving scenarios.

## Implementation

To utilize this feature, append `:thinking` to your model identifier:

```json
{
  "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1:thinking"
}
```

## Functionality

Models with the thinking variant offer access to sophisticated reasoning engines that support thorough analysis and sequential problem-solving approaches. According to the documentation, this feature "enables extended reasoning capabilities for complex problem-solving tasks," making it especially beneficial for projects requiring chain-of-thought methodologies.

## Additional Resources

The documentation references a related guide on [Reasoning Tokens](/docs/best-practices/reasoning-tokens) for further exploration of this capability.
