# Free Variant Documentation

## Overview

The `:free` variant feature on OpenRouter enables access to complimentary model versions by appending the suffix to model identifiers.

## Implementation

To utilize free models, add `:free` to your model ID:

```json
{
  "model": "meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free"
}
```

## Key Characteristics

"Free variants provide access to models without cost, but may have different rate limits or availability compared to paid versions." This means users gain zero-cost inference capability, though usage may be subject to different operational constraints than premium tiers.

## Additional Resources

The documentation references the Free Models Router feature available in the Chat Playground, which offers a complementary way to explore cost-free inference options on the platform.
