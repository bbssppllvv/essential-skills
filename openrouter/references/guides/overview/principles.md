# Principles | OpenRouter's Core Values and Mission

## Overview

OpenRouter is a platform enabling developers to access and optimize AI model usage across multiple providers. The service operates on the premise that "the future is multi-model and multi-provider."

## Core Value Propositions

**Price and Performance**
OpenRouter identifies competitive pricing and optimal performance metrics (latency, throughput) across numerous providers, allowing users to customize their prioritization preferences.

**Standardized API**
The unified interface eliminates the need for code modifications when transitioning between models or vendors. Users may delegate selection and payment responsibilities to end users through OAuth integration.

**Real-World Insights**
The platform provides early access to newly released models and usage analytics, demonstrating which solutions perform best for specific use cases. Community engagement occurs through their Discord channel.

**Consolidated Billing**
A single, transparent billing system simplifies accounting regardless of the quantity of providers utilized.

**Higher Availability**
The service implements backup routing options and intelligent request distribution, ensuring functionality persists during provider outages.

**Higher Rate Limits**
Direct partnerships with model providers yield improved rate limits and increased throughput capacity.
