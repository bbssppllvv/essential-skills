# Report Feedback Documentation

## Overview
OpenRouter enables users to flag problematic AI generations through a dedicated feedback system. The feature allows reporting of issues across multiple categories to help the platform improve.

## Available Feedback Categories

The system organizes issues into seven categories:

* **Latency** - "Response was slower than expected"
* **Incoherence** - "Response didn't make sense or was off-topic"
* **Incorrect Response** - "Response contained factual errors or wrong information"
* **Formatting** - "Response had formatting issues (markdown, code blocks, etc.)"
* **Billing** - "Unexpected charges or token counts"
* **API Error** - "Technical errors or failed requests"
* **Other** - Miscellaneous issues

## Submission Methods

### Via Chatroom
Users can report feedback directly within conversations by hovering over assistant messages and clicking the bug icon, then selecting a category and providing context before submitting.

### Via Activity Page
Two approaches are available on the Activity page:
- **Per-generation reporting**: Click the bug icon on specific rows in activity history
- **General reporting**: Use the header button to submit feedback when you have a generation ID available

## Processing
Submitted feedback helps the team enhance "Model routing and provider selection, Error handling and recovery, Billing accuracy, Overall platform reliability."
