# OpenRouter Organization Management Documentation

## Overview

OpenRouter organizations allow teams to collaborate by pooling credits, managing API keys centrally, and tracking usage across members. This setup suits companies seeking centralized cost management and AI oversight.

## Creating Organizations

Users must navigate to Settings > Preferences and click **Create Organization** to establish one. A verified email address is required. After setup, team members can be invited to join.

## Account Switching

Members can toggle between personal and organization contexts using the organization switcher at the top of the web application. All actions performed in organization mode affect the organization's resources.

## Credit System

### Shared Pool Benefits

Organizations maintain a unified credit account enabling "centralized billing" where all purchased credits serve any member. This approach simplifies accounting and provides budget oversight.

### Administrative Controls

Only administrators can purchase credits, view billing details, or manage payment methods. Regular members cannot access these functions and must contact administrators for credit needs.

### Credit Transfers

Moving credits from personal accounts to organizational ones requires emailing support@openrouter.ai with organization details and transfer amounts. This process is manual and cannot occur automatically through the platform interface.

## API Key Management

All members can create API keys, though they view only their own. However, "keys created by any organization member can be used by all members," with usage billed to the shared pool.

Administrators gain broader permissions, viewing and managing all organizational keys while accessing comprehensive usage analytics.

## Activity Tracking

Organization members see all colleague activity within the activity feed when in organization context, including model usage and costs. The system can filter activity by specific API keys.

## Administrative Functions

Administrators control provider settings, privacy policies, member management, and billing configurations. The platform supports two roles: Admin (full access) and Member (limited access).

## Limitations and FAQ

- Organizations support maximum 10 members
- Members viewing the activity feed see usage metadata across the organization
- Users can join multiple organizations simultaneously
- Leaving an organization revokes access to its resources but preserves personal accounts
